## IBM on a Smarter Government and Why Data is Amazing
### What is Watson?

You’ve probably heard of IBM’s Watson, a machine learning platform which “uses natural language processing to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data” and which famously competed against humans on Jeopardy back in 2012.  What you may not be as familiar with is the Watson team’s work with the government and private groups to modernize industries like healthcare and public transportation.

According to Watson, “vibrant economies are built on insights” and they are working to help industries, which traditionally have little access to big data, to pull together existing information into actionable insights and progress.

### Smarter Public Safety

IBM is committed to changing our communities for the better.  Public safety and crime reduction have a clear impact on the economic stability of an area but, what can Watson do to support this?

Enter big data! The team is pitching the use of their software to provide insights into crime patterns and trends for cities using data that they already have but, presently, do not have the technology to analyze or use.  In particular, IBM has been working with the police department in Memphis to provide instant access to analytics on a particular crime the moment it is reported in the system.  Giving them access to any related criminal history, available officers, and a track on that type of crime by week, month, and year in their area. While this is data that the team had access to in some form before using Watson’s tech, time is key in resolving a lot of these crimes and, within 5 years, the district saw a decrease in crime of 28% with no increases in staffing.  Definitely something worth investing in!

### Smarter Healthcare

The health industry is another field that the public is anxious to make digital.  According to IBM’s site…
“Inefficiency wastes up to 40% of worldwide healthcare spending” and, “Analysts predict that using big data in U.S. healthcare can save up to $450 billion annually”.  

So, what solutions does Watson offer?  Better analytics of existing data and integration of background data from multiple resources into one power-platform!  In particular, the Watson team worked with a health provider in Europe to connect data from multiple departments and create better flagging systems for individual patient needs which reduced patient costs up to 15%!

### Final Thoughts

A lot of these may seem like obvious steps and you could ask, “What is so revolutionary about using statistics?”.  In these cases, it’s not necessarily about creating new solutions but creating a way to make them accessible to the industries that need them most.  Provide less expensive, more streamlined tools to hospitals and police forces that allow them to save money and provide better service in the long run.
In addition to working on big projects like the ones mentioned in this article, Watson also offers some really cool APIs!  Some are expensive and intended for business use but, there are free options which you can check out on their site and use in your next project!
